Java & MySQL Stored Procedures - Upload daily data file of stock, into the back end of my Opencart online store.

## Description
I have built up an online shop, I’m using a business model called “drop shipping” where I just have to sell goods online and my supplier will deal with the physical goods.
* I had to setup an online shop, install and configure LAMP Stack, Opencart, GLPI, Webmin and Open Web Analytics, on my Ubuntu Linux server (and my test server).
* Write my own Java application to import text files onto the server backend. My supplier has a list of thousands of products and my Java application has to populate a full range of different MySQL tables to upload this data into my shop, whilst reporting errors in the data, (or any errors). Developing this Java tool was the most time consuming task.
* Configuring and managing all the different systems whether it’s the ticking system where I need to edit a couple of twig files or writing my own cookie warning so that I can put a wrapper around the Open Web Analytics code.
* I basically did everything from system admin, software development as well as everything else.
